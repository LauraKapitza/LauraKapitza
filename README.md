Hi, I' Laura. Nice to see you on my GitHub page 👋

After graduating from university, I thought my passion lies in Marketing and PR. Yet, after working as a Marketing consultant for one year, I have realized that it is not the field I want to follow a career in the long term.

After moving to France, I took the opportunity to rethink my career choice and to learn new skills. I tried some programming in Python. I immediately fell in love with it because it allows me to solve real problems and create innovative products or features.

Programming is so much fun that I decided to commit to it. Therefore I am currently participating in Ironhack's Web Development Bootcamp to become a Full-stack JavaScript Developer. This Bootcamp is challenging yet so rewarding, and it showed me that programming is a new career path that I will enjoy and thrive on.

After finishing my Bootcamp, I am looking for an entry position as Junior Full-Stack Developer in and around Paris. If you are interested in my profile, feel free to connect with me!
